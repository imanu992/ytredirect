# Guide to YouTube Redirect

## What is YouTube Redirect?

**YouTube Redirect** is a shortcut designed to improve your video-watching experience on iPhone.  
How many times have you received a YouTube link on WhatsApp or Reddit, opened itâ€¦ and ended up in Safari?  
Even with the YouTube app installed, links often open in the browserâ€”limiting features like auto quality, comments, and smooth navigation.

**YouTube Redirect solves this with a single tap. Letâ€™s see how!**

## Main Feature

When you open a YouTube link in Safari (e.g. from WhatsApp, Reddit, Telegram, etc.), simply tap the **Share icon**, scroll through the options, and select **YouTube Redirect**.

The shortcut will automatically analyze the current URL and launch the video directly in the **YouTube app**, so you can continue watching with all features enabled.

## Advanced Usage (without a shared input)

If you run YouTube Redirect without sharing a URL (for example from **Spotlight**, your **Home Screen**, or the **Shortcuts app**), an interactive menu will appear with several useful actions:

1. **Paste from clipboard**  
   If youâ€™ve copied a YouTube link, open it instantly in the official app.

2. **Enter URL manually**  
   Ideal if youâ€™ve written down a link or want to paste one directly.

3. **Visit the website**  
   Stay up to date with updates, news, and useful resources on the official site.

4. **Send feedback / Report a bug**  
   Encountered an issue or have a suggestion? Reach out directly.

5. **Quit**  
   Exit the shortcut without performing any action.
